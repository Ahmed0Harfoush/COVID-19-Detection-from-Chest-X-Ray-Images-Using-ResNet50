# COVID-19-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images-Using-ResNet50
This notebook presents a deep learning approach for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using Transfer Learning with ResNet50.  The objective of this project is to automatically classify X-ray images into two categories:  COVID-19  Normal

⚠️ Small Dataset Challenge

One of the main challenges in this project is the limited size of the dataset.

Because the number of available images is small:

Each epoch contains very few batches

Accuracy fluctuates significantly during training

The model may easily overfit

Validation results can be unstable
